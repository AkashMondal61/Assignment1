Assignment: CSV File Parser Backend 
Objective
Create a backend service that reads a CSV file from the local system, processes each row, and logs details such as:
Total rows processedService
Successfully parsed rows
Failed rows due to errors
Time taken to parse the file
Project Requirements
1. Read CSV File
The service should read a CSV file from the local system.
It should log the total number of rows in the file before processing.
2. Parse Each Row
The service should iterate row by row in the CSV.
If a row is valid, it should count as a successful row.
If there's a parsing error, it should log a detailed error message and continue processing the next row.
3. Error Handling & Logging
If a row has missing or invalid data, log an error with the row number and reason for failure.
The service should not stop on errors—continue processing the next rows.
4. Logging Output
At the end of processing, log the following summary:
✔ Total Rows → Total rows in the file
✔ Success Row Count → Number of valid rows processed
✔ Failed Row Count → Number of rows with errors
✔ Time Taken → Total time taken to parse the file
